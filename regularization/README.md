# Regularization, Training and Validation using sklearn

I wanted to test out how regularization works in python on supervised learning models. I used sklearn for this. Earlier I have done this in MATLAB so concepts were already clear; only implementation was the new learning for me.

Here are all the referenced I used for this.

[L1 and L2 regularization](https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c)
[DataConversionWarning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39214164/data-conversion-error-while-applying-a-function-to-each-row-in-pandas-python)
[training-testing accuracy](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_is_it_possible_to_obtain_better_results_on_the_test_set_than_on_the_training_set)


I've added a few more stuff since then -- basically testing and validation part.
Here are the links for references:

Hope it helps!
