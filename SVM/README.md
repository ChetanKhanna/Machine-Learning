# Support Vector Machine

This was inspired from Prof. Andrew Ng's course on coursera.
Here is the link of all the resources I looked into
+ [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
+ [SVM tutorial](https://stackabuse.com/implementing-svm-and-kernel-svm-with-pythons-scikit-learn/)
+ [confusion matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/)

Hope it helps!
