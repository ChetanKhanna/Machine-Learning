# Housing price prediction

This is the first project from the wonderful book Hands on Machine Learning with Sklearn and Tensorflow

+ [Stratified Split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html)
+ [Imputer](https://medium.com/@contactsunny/handle-missing-data-in-your-training-dataset-with-scikit-imputer-f4bbf005fc5e)
+ [Custom Estimator](http://danielhnyk.cz/creating-your-own-estimator-scikit-learn/)
+ [Feature Union](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html)

I've also added the book seperately.

Hope it helps!
