# Recommender Systems

This is probably the last thing that I'll implement while going through Prof. Andrew Ng's course.
Here are the links to all the references that I used while writting the code:
+ [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/uG59z/content-based-recommendations)
+ [Python implementation](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python#comments)
+ [Similarity Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/overview-of-text-similarity-metrics-3397c4601f50)
+ [cosine-similary reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html)
+ [linear-kernal reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.linear_kernel.html)
+ [Error -- why we limit the size of vectorizer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16332083/python-memoryerror-when-doing-fitting-with-scikit-learn)

Hope it helps! Happy learning.
